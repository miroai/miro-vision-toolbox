# Welcome to [Miro AI](https://miro.io/)'s Vision Toolbox

This site contains the project documentation for the
`toolbox` project that contains all the most commonly used
utility functions curated by our data science team.

Its aim is to give you a computer vision toolbox to build your
own project and hit the ground running!

> Things don't have to change the world to be important.

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [DiÃ¡taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.

This package would not have existed without the amazing community of Pythonistas and Computer-Vision enthusiasts. References are cited throughout each function's documentation. This package in turn is our contribution back to the community :heart:

Thank you :pray_tone3: and let's build more beautiful things together!
